# Hcaptcha

Rails gem made to use Hcaptcha bot protection in your Rails applications.
Official documentation is available [here](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hcaptcha'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hcaptcha

## Configuration

Create an account on [Hcaptcha website](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) and ask for API keys.

And then add an initializer

```ruby
# config/initializers/hcaptcha.rb

Hcaptcha.configure do |config|
  config.site_key = [YOUR PUBLIC SITE KEY]
  config.secret_key = [YOUR SECRET KEY]
  # optional, default value = https://hcaptcha.com/siteverify
  config.verify_url = [VERIFY URL]
end
```

## Usage

An h-captcha-response will be generated by inserting `hcaptcha_tag` inside your form.
You must validate this token in your controller method with `verify_hcaptcha` method.

exemple:
```html
# app/views/foos/new.html.erb
<form>
  ...
  <%= hcaptcha_tag %>

  [submit]
</form>
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/foos_controller.rb

...
  def create
    captcha_validated, captcha_response = verify_hcaptcha
    if captcha_validated
      [Your code goes here]
    else
      flash[:error] = captcha_response[:error_codes]
      render :new
    end
  end
...
```

## Invisible Hcaptcha

To use invisible Hcaptcha, simply add option `size: invisible` to `hcaptcha_tag` method call.
This will create an invisible input that, on submit of your form, will request a token to hcaptcha.
As of Hcapthca documentation, `the user will only be presented with a hCaptcha challenge if that user has not built up enough trust.`

:warning:
Since `Rails >= 5`, submit buttons are automatically binded with a `data-disabled-with` attribute.
As invisible hcaptcha will be binded on your form submit button, you should disable this option otherwise if a Challenge is requested
and the user close it, he will not be able to submit again the form.
You can disable it either globally in your app like so

```ruby
config.action_view.automatically_disable_submit_tag = false
```

or, to do it ad-hoc for specific buttons, add this to the submit button

```ruby
data: { disable_with: false }
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
